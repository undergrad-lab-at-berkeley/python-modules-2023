    "##### An informal introduction\n",
    "When we write code, we want to be able to <b>control</b> the flow of our program. What does this mean? It means, we want our program to make decisions based on some conditions. You can of this as standing at a crossroads. You are standing at a crossroad that leads to 3 different places: School, home and the park. If you wanted to head to the park, you would look at the sign and decide to take the path that leads to the park. We do this very easily in our brain, but the computer takes a methodic approach. It uses <b>conditional expressions</b> to make its decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conditional expressions\n",
    "A <b>conditional expression</b> is an expression that evaluates to a `boolean` value: <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. These expressions consist of operators such as `not`, `and`, `or`, `>`, `<`, `==`. We can construction intricate expressions with these operations and often use parentheses to improve clarity. Python's order of operations follow the same rules as mathematics (read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence))."

    "Here are 5 common error messages, what they mean, and how to diagnose the root problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <b>SyntaxError</b>: invalid syntax. You've messed up the \"grammar\" of a Python program! Common causes include:\n",
    "- forgetting the parentheses in a call expression\n",
    "- forgetting the colon at the end of a conditional <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) <b>IndentationError</b>: expected an indented block. In Python, indentation is particularly important because it can change the meaning of a program. Whenever you have a block of code that falls under a statement, it must be consistently indented (usually 2 / 4 spaces, or a tab), and deviations will result in this error. Common causes include:\n",
    "- forgetting to indent a block of statements inside <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, etc. properly\n",
    "- forgetting to indent the code block inside a user-defined function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) <b>IndentationError</b>: unexpected indent. As mentioned above, consistent indentation is imperative! If you indent a line inside a block by 3 spaces and the following line by 5, you'll get this error. Common causes include:\n",
    "- forgetting to indent a block of statements inside <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, etc. properly\n",
    "- forgetting to indent the code block inside a user-defined function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) <b>NameError</b>: global name '[some_variable_name]' is not defined. Python has built-in functions, which means that it automatically knows what <code>print</code> means. It doesn't know what \"hello\" means though, and will be confused by a statement that includes a previously unknown name. Common causes include:\n",
    "- not assigning a value to a variable before using it in a statement\n",
    "- misspelling a built-in function name e.g. <code>pront</code> instead of <code>print</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) <b>TypeError</b>: Can't convert [some_data_type] object to [some_other_data_type] implicitly. When you're trying to perform an unsupported operation, usually on items of different data types, Python reacts with this error e.g. \"5\" + 5 which makes no sense unless both objects are of the same type. Common causes include:\n",
    "- combining a number and a string\n",
    "- trying to add an element to list using a + sign e.g. [4, 5, 6] + 4 (concatenation requires both elements involved in the operation to be the same type)"

    "## Commenting\n",
    "As you're working through your projects, it's important to add <i>documentation</i> to your code, especially if you're relying on long blocks of data analysis. There's a high chance that when you come back to enumerate your analysis steps for your final paper / presentation / poster, you won't remember the exact purpose of line 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "What most programmers do in case of this is add <i>comments</i>. Comments are lines in the code that the computer doesn't read / execute (so Python syntax rules don't apply), but that humans do read! Comments usually include information about what a certain function does or why a particular block of statements was executed. There's no overarching rule for what a comment should look like, but in general they should be informative and concise; they should be readable for someone who hasn't seen your code before.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 types of comments in Python—single line and multiline (only used at the start/end of files, generally).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a single line comment is <code>&#x23; [insert comment here]</code>. For a multiline comment it is <code>\"\"\" [insert multiline comment here] \"\"\"</code>. Here are some examples of comments:\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "As you go about learning more about the Python language and CS fundamentals you will often run into questions? Aside from the ULAB staff, here are 2 resources that for the most part compose the Bible of Python programmers and can provide a lot of insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <a href = \"https://docs.python.org/3/\">The official Python language documentation</a>! This is not very accessible for a beginning programmer, so you can also try the <a href = \"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/\">Python tutorial</a>.<br>\n",
    "2) <a href = \"https://stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a>. Your question is almost certainly not unique, and if you search it on the StackOverflow database, you'll probably get a good explanation from those active on the forum. (Eventually, you can give back to the community by answering questions yourself!) Note: Be sure to search by language."
