    "Even if these look reasonable (some sort of oscillation that's roughly correlated), it's not that easy to understand what's physically happening yet. Ideally, we want to see how the pendulum is actually moving in space. In the next module, we'll explore some plotting and animation tools to help us do this, as well as shifting our simulation over to `.py` files so that it's easier to maintain!"
